# Aether API Reference

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the Aether API. Our API is designed to be RESTful, intuitive, and powerful, allowing you to integrate Aether's flight weather information capabilities into your own applications.

## Table of Contents

1. [Authentication](authentication.md)
2. Endpoints
   - [Flights](endpoints/flights.md)
   - [Weather](endpoints/weather.md)
   - [Reports](endpoints/reports.md)
3. [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
4. [Rate Limiting](rate-limiting.md)
5. [Versioning](versioning.md)

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.aether.com/v1
```

## Authentication

Aether uses API keys for authentication. For details on how to obtain and use your API key, see our [Authentication Guide](authentication.md).

## Request Format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` in your requests.

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-09-28T12:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

For detailed information on each endpoint, please refer to the specific endpoint documentation linked in the Table of Contents.

# Aether System Architecture

This section provides an in-depth look at the architecture of the Aether Flight Weather Information System. Understanding this architecture is crucial for developers working on the system, as well as for system administrators responsible for deployment and maintenance.

## Table of Contents

1. [High-Level Overview](high-level-overview.md)
2. [Data Flow](data-flow.md)
3. [Database Schema](database-schema.md)
4. [Caching Strategy](caching-strategy.md)
5. [Security](security.md)

## System Components

Aether is built using a microservices architecture, with the following key components:

1. **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests, authentication, and rate limiting.
2. **Flight Service**: Manages flight data and operations.
3. **Weather Service**: Retrieves and processes weather information.
4. **Report Service**: Generates comprehensive flight weather reports.
5. **Kafka**: Enables asynchronous communication between services.
6. **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store for persistent data.
7. **Redis**: Caching layer for improved performance.

For a visual representation of how these components interact, please refer to our [High-Level Overview](high-level-overview.md).

## Key Design Principles

1. **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle high loads and can be easily scaled horizontally.
2. **Resilience**: Fault tolerance is built into the system, with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms.
3. **Performance**: Caching and efficient data processing ensure quick response times.
4. **Security**: Multi-layered security approach, including encryption, authentication, and authorization.
5. **Maintainability**: Modular design and comprehensive documentation facilitate easy maintenance and updates.
